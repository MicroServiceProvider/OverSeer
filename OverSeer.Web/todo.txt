next todo:
- make graph less complicated so it doesnt look clutered that much

ideas:
- make a solution to have some services failing randomaly ?
- how to decluter
   - on click select node and make it central ?
   - show only direct deps and not share deps ?
   - show deps as a tree not share them that much ?
- dependancy direction ( consumer, provider )
- expose number of requests and make the line bigger smaller
- token id to track error messages ?
- make circles bigger smaller based on data ?
- create special filter menu to change graph
  - like number of 500s etc

- zoom on scroll
